# Musica-alpha-v0.3
This is the reporsitory for Musica alpha v0.3.
I am so happy to announce my first app with a proper release. But as with working with haste, there are some things to look our for.
1. **Assets May be missing**.
The assets are not in one resource folder. which if you do not have assets of the name and path, it may show blank. This problem will be absolutely tackled after some months as I am working on something else planned to be big.

2. **You have to have .NET Framework 4.8**.
You have to have .NET Framework 4.8 in order to use it. If you go through _setup_ you may have it auto installed with the Musica setup.

Musica is a actually called MusicaTwo for reasons.

Please enjoy! This is my first app properly released through GitHub. Still in alpha pahse, it is still very accomplishing!

Thank you for downloading!
